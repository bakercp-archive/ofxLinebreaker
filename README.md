ofxLinebreaker
==============

A wrapper for liblinebreak, implementation of the line breaking algorithm as described in Unicode 6.0.0 Standard Annex 14, Revision 26. It breaks lines that contain Unicode characters.

While liblinebreak is an excellent library, it may be replaced by ICU in order to support more languages.  The the ofLinebreak interface will remain the same."
